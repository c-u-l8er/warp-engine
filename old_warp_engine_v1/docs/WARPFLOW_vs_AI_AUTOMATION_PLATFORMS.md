**WarpFlow's System 2 Revolution:**
```elixir
# Traditional AI Automation (200+ lines)
def process_customer_request(request) do
  # Complex imperative logic with manual rules
  classification = classify_request(request)
  if classification.priority == "urgent" do
    if classification.type == "billing" do
      route_to_billing_team(request)
    else
      route_to_general_support(request)
    end
  else
    # ... 150+ more lines of nested conditions
  end
end

# WarpFlow System 2 Reasoning (15 lines)
fold customer_request do
  UrgentIssue(request, context) ->
    # Wormhole route: Critical issues get instant expert escalation
    wormhole_escalate(request, find_optimal_expert(context))
    
  ComplexProblem(request, knowledge_base) ->
    # Quantum entanglement: Related knowledge influences reasoning
    quantum_reason(request, entangled_knowledge(knowledge_base))
    
  RoutineQuery(request, past_solutions) ->
    # Gravitational routing: Similar solutions attract processing
    gravitational_solve(request, attract_similar_solutions(past_solutions))
end
```
